CAT: cat < input > output    : if input file doesn't exist add_history leaks (maybe solved when exiting the shell since history is being freed at the very end)

EXPANDER: remove quotes //add check to exclude empty str in between quotations?
            echo '""'"$USER"'""' | cat -e leaking

QUESTIONS
    - how should ctrl \ react with cat
