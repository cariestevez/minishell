EXPORT:
segfault
(). export var=test | echo $var
    leaks :()

REDIRECTIONS:
            if not_valid_cmd > file1 > file2
            if no_command > file 
            = add_history leaks

CAT: cat < input > output    : if input file doesn't exist add_history leaks (maybe solved when exiting the shell since history is being freed at the very end)

PARSER:  ex. "ls >a>b>c" if redirectons after the first one are not separated by whitespace, they are pased as command args and not redirections

EXPANDER: remove quotes //add check to exclude empty str in between quotations?

when 'command not found' add_history leaks (maybe solved when exiting the shell since history is being freed at the very end)

ex.
        commands and anything inside is being freed (solved in my branch but fucked up other things)
