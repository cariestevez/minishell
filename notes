!missing ft_exit();!

PARSING+REDIRECTIONS: if input = "> file", bash creates thefile and return the prompt. minishell segfaults
                        (I need to come up with a solution)
                        if redirectons after the first one are not separated by whitespace, they are pased as command args and not redirections
                        ex. "ls >a>b>c"

REDIRECTIONS:
                if not_valid_cmd > file1 > file2 : creates the 1st file (sometimes also the 2nd) prints multiple \n and waits for input
    redirections and pipes do not work 0____o
    echo > / >> doesnt give back the prompt but does what it should

RANDOM: when pressing tab(without enter) it 'executes' ls -a?!
