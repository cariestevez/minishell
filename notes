EXPORT:
segfault
(). export var=test | echo $var
    should display \n, but segfaults

PARSER: count_tokens: when number of cmds < num of redirections ->segfault

PARSING+REDIRECTIONS: if input = "> file", bash creates thefile and return the prompt. minishell segfaults
                        (I need to come up with a solution)
                        if redirectons after the first one are not separated by whitespace, they are pased as command args and not redirections
                        ex. "ls >a>b>c"

REDIRECTIONS:
                if not_valid_cmd > file1 > file2 : creates the 1st file (sometimes also the 2nd) prints multiple \n and waits for input

EXPANDER: remove quotes //add check to exclude empty str in between quotations?
QUOTATIONS = what the hell are the rules for this:
emollebr@c4a7c6:~/A_project_directory/minishell_collab$ echo "'"'"'$USER'"'"'"
'"emollebr"'
emollebr@c4a7c6:~/A_project_directory/minishell_collab$ echo '"'"'$USER'"'"'
"'emollebr'"                                                                            
emollebr@c4a7c6:~/A_project_directory/minishell_collab$ echo "'"'$USER'"'"
'$USER'

CAT:    when running cat without args, prints multiple \n and waits for input
        cat < input > output    : if input file exists, doens't create the output file just prints input file
                             : if input file doesn't exist --> open: Bad file descriptor and waits for input

RANDOM: when pressing tab(without enter) it 'executes' ls -a?!

MEMORY: Something that shouldnt be freed is being freed after returning to main, running a command second time causes problems where no problems occured on the first command
ex.
        commands and anything inside is being freed (solved in my branch but fucked up other things)
        memory leak when piping with a builtin
