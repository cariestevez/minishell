PARSING+REDIRECTIONS: 
        if input = "> file", bash creates thefile and return the prompt. minishell segfaults
                (I need to come up with a solution)
        if redirectons after the first one are not separated by whitespace, they are pased as command args and not redirections
                ex. "ls >a>b>c"

RANDOM: when pressing tab(without enter) it 'executes' ls -a?!
