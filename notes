!missing ft_exit();!

EXPORT: segfault
(). export var=test | echo $var
    should display \n, but segfaults
echo: frees invalid pointer if more than one argument

PARSER: count_tokens: when number of cmds < num of redirections ->segfault

PARSING+REDIRECTIONS: if input = "> file", bash creates thefile and return the prompt. minishell segfaults
                        (I need to come up with a solution to distinguis between )


EXPANDER: remove quotes //add check to exclude empty str in between quotations?

CD: sets error code to 0 after perror, even though there was an error

CAT:    when running cat without args, prints multiple \n and waits for input
        cat < input > output    : if input file exists, doens't create the output file just prints input file
                             : if input file doesn't exist --> open: Bad file descriptor and waits for input

FREEING/EXITING: if execute doesnt find command, frees invalid pointer

EXECUTION: in some cases, minishell prints a newline before the expected output???

RANDOM: when pressing tab(without enter) it 'executes' ls -a?!
