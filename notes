!missing ft_exit();!

EXPORT: segfault
(). export var=test | echo $var
    should display \n, but segfaults
echo: frees invalid pointer if more than one argument

PARSING+REDIRECTIONS: if input = "> file", bash creates thefile and return the prompt. minishell segfaults 

CD: sets error code to 0 after perror, even though there was an error

PARSING: segfault on no input, on single space, multiple space+tab

FREEING/EXITING: if execute doesnt find command, frees invalid pointer

EXECUTION: in some cases, minishell prints a newline before the expected output???
